# Content Design Agency

A complete AI agency specializing in Content Design. 15 specialized agents for UX writing, microcopy, content strategy, and conversation design — each with structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, and few-shot examples ready for integration.

Built on the principles of [msitarzewski/agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents). Each agent is:

- **Specialized**: Deep expertise in specific content design domains
- **Machine-Parseable**: Structured YAML frontmatter with typed inputs/outputs
- **Prompt-Engineered**: Real system prompts with few-shot examples, not personality fluff
- **Composable**: Agents reference each other via `related_agents` for multi-step workflows

## Quick Start

1. **Pick an agent** from the table below (or use the [decision tree](./docs/WHEN_TO_USE.md))
2. **Copy the agent file** to your AI system
3. **Use the System Prompt section** as your system message and the Few-Shot Examples for calibration

Not sure which agent to use? Start with the [Content Designer Generalist](./content-design/content-designer-generalist.md) — it will recommend specialists.

## Not Sure Which Agent? → [Decision Tree](./docs/WHEN_TO_USE.md)

The decision tree maps every common content design task to the right agent, including multi-agent handoff patterns.

difficulty_level: beginner | intermediate | advanced
tags: [searchable, keywords]
inputs:
  - name: field_name
    type: string
    required: true
    description: What this input is
outputs:
  - name: field_name
    type: string
    description: What this output contains
related_agents:
  - other-agent-name
```

Plus markdown sections:
- **System Prompt** — Drop-in system message for your LLM
- **Few-Shot Examples** — Input/output pairs showing ideal behavior

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the full plan. Next up:

- **Runtime engine** — Make agents executable via Python SDK
- **Multi-agent workflows** — Chain agents into pipelines (Content Audit, Launch Package, etc.)
- **Before/after examples** — Real case studies proving quality improvements
- **Scoring tools** — Automated readability, accessibility, and brand voice scoring
- **CLI** — Run agents from the terminal

## Integration with `content-design-prompt-library`

This agency works alongside the [content-design-prompt-library](https://github.com/adedayoagarau/content-design-prompt-library). Use prompts from the library as input to the agents here for structured, high-quality content generation.

## Contributing
