# Content Design Agency

A complete AI agency specializing in Content Design. 15 specialized agents for UX writing, microcopy, content strategy, and conversation design — each with structured inputs/outputs, system prompts, and few-shot examples ready for integration.

Built on the principles of [msitarzewski/agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents). Each agent is:

- **Specialized**: Deep expertise in specific content design domains
- **Machine-Parseable**: Structured YAML frontmatter with typed inputs/outputs
- **Prompt-Engineered**: Real system prompts with few-shot examples, not personality fluff
- **Composable**: Agents reference each other via `related_agents` for multi-step workflows

## Quick Start

1. **Pick an agent** from the table below (or use the [decision tree](./docs/WHEN_TO_USE.md))
2. **Copy the agent file** to your AI system
3. **Use the System Prompt section** as your system message and the Few-Shot Examples for calibration

Not sure which agent to use? Start with the [Content Designer Generalist](./content-design/content-designer-generalist.md) — it will recommend specialists.

## Not Sure Which Agent? → [Decision Tree](./docs/WHEN_TO_USE.md)

The decision tree maps every common content design task to the right agent, including multi-agent handoff patterns.

## Agent File Structure

Every agent file includes:

```yaml
# YAML Frontmatter
name: Agent Name
description: One-line description
version: "1.0.0"
difficulty_level: beginner | intermediate | advanced
tags: [searchable, keywords]
inputs:
  - name: field_name
    type: string
    required: true
    description: What this input is
outputs:
  - name: field_name
    type: string
    description: What this output contains
related_agents:
  - other-agent-name
```

Plus markdown sections:
- **System Prompt** — Drop-in system message for your LLM
- **Few-Shot Examples** — Input/output pairs showing ideal behavior
- **Core Mission** — What the agent does
- **Critical Rules** — Constraints and principles
- **Technical Deliverables** — What it produces
- **Workflow Process** — Step-by-step interaction flow
- **Success Metrics** — How to measure quality

## Runtime SDK

Agents are executable via the Python runtime. Install and use programmatically or from the CLI.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable (see `.env.example`).

### CLI Usage

```bash
# List all agents
cd-agency agent list

# Filter by tag or difficulty
cd-agency agent list --tag mobile
cd-agency agent list --difficulty beginner

# Get agent details (supports aliases: "error", "cta", "a11y", "tone", etc.)
cd-agency agent info error

# Run an agent
cd-agency agent run error-message-architect -i "API returns 503 during checkout"
cd-agency agent run microcopy -i "Click here to proceed" -F ui_context="checkout button"

# Pipe input
echo "Submit" | cd-agency agent run cta

# JSON output
cd-agency agent run tone -i "Your request has been denied." --json-output
```

### Python SDK

```python
from runtime import load_agent, AgentRegistry, Config
from runtime.runner import AgentRunner

# Load a single agent
agent = load_agent(Path("content-design/error-message-architect.md"))

# Or use the registry (supports aliases)
registry = AgentRegistry.from_directory(Path("content-design"))
agent = registry.get("error")  # alias for error-message-architect

# Run the agent
config = Config.from_env()
runner = AgentRunner(config)
result = runner.run(agent, {
    "error_scenario": "Payment gateway timeout",
    "severity": "critical",
    "target_audience": "non-technical shopper",
})

print(result.content)       # The agent's response
print(result.input_tokens)  # Token usage
print(result.latency_ms)    # Response time
```

## See It In Action

Every agent ships with before/after case studies showing measurable improvements. Here are highlights:

### Individual Agent Examples

| Agent | Case Study | Key Result |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Error Message Architect | [E-commerce 503 error](./examples/error-message-architect-01.md) | Generic "Something went wrong" → empathetic message with 3 resolution steps |
| Microcopy Review | [Registration form labels](./examples/microcopy-review-02.md) | 319 chars → 43 chars (87% reduction), readability Grade 14 → Grade 3 |
| CTA Optimization | [SaaS pricing page](./examples/cta-optimization-01.md) | "Submit" → "Start my free trial" with 5 psychology-backed variations |
| Onboarding Flow Designer | [Mobile banking first login](./examples/onboarding-flow-designer-02.md) | 7 screens → 2 screens, 3 min → 45 sec to reach account |
| Accessibility Auditor | [Dashboard visualizations](./examples/accessibility-content-auditor-02.md) | 5 WCAG violations → 0, full color-blind + keyboard support |

### Multi-Agent Workflow Examples

| Workflow | Case Study | What Happened |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Content Audit (4 agents) | [Healthcare appointment page](./examples/workflow-content-audit-01.md) | 4-agent pipeline: structural fix → tone calibration → a11y audit → microcopy polish. Readability Grade 14 → Grade 5 |
| Launch Content Package (4 agents) | [Feature launch — Team Insights](./examples/workflow-launch-content-package-01.md) | 3 agents in parallel (onboarding + CTAs + empty states) → generalist consolidation. 10 content pieces, 282 words, terminology-consistent |

All 17 case studies follow a [consistent template](./examples/TEMPLATE.md): Context → Before → After → What Changed & Why → Measurable Difference.

Browse all examples in the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory.

## Workflows

Chain agents into multi-step pipelines using YAML workflow definitions:

```bash
# List available workflows
cd-agency workflow list

# Run a content audit pipeline
cd-agency workflow run content-audit --field content="Your button text here"

# Run a launch content package (parallel agents + consolidation)
cd-agency workflow run launch-content-package --field feature_name="Team Insights"
```

5 pre-built workflows in [`workflows/`](./workflows/):
- **Content Audit** — Generalist → Tone → Accessibility → Microcopy (sequential)
- **Error Message Pipeline** — Error Architect → Tone → A11y → Mobile (sequential)
- **Launch Content Package** — Onboarding + CTA + Empty State (parallel) → Generalist (consolidation)
- **Localization Prep** — L10n → Generalist simplification → A11y check (sequential)
- **Notification Suite** — Notifications → Mobile → Tone → CTA (sequential)

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the full plan. Next up:

- **Scoring tools** — Automated readability, accessibility, and brand voice scoring
- **Design system presets** — Pre-configured tone/voice profiles per brand

## Integration with `content-design-prompt-library`

This agency works alongside the [content-design-prompt-library](https://github.com/adedayoagarau/content-design-prompt-library). Use prompts from the library as input to the agents here for structured, high-quality content generation.
